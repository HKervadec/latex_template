\section{Introduction}
    This small template is aimed at making my life easier in the future.

    I will add with time a list of useful packages and what they do, to avoid too much bloat in new projects.

    \subsection{Figures}
        Below a few examples of figures, especially in a two columns environment.
        First, remember that Figure \ref{fig:intro:shadoko} is always here to help.

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figure/intro/shadoko}
            \label{fig:intro:shadoko}
            \caption{He is watching over us.\cite{denis2012de}}
        \end{figure}


        For figures that takes the whole page, please see the code of Figure \ref{fig:intro:widsom}.
        \begin{figure*}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/intro/wisdom}
            \label{fig:intro:widsom}
            \caption{A few words of wisdoms from the Shadoks.}
        \end{figure*}
